# The Python Computer
My attempt at building a virtual computer entirely within Python. I'm doing this to teach myself how a computer does what it does. I was inpired by the excellent [YouTube series by Ben Eater](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU), and most of what I attempt is just replicating his work. I chose to attempt this in Python because I live in London and can't justify having a whole room (or even desk) dedicated to electronics. 

As this project advances I plan on fleshing out this introduction. Stay posted for more...
