# The Python Computer
The project detailed within is my attempt at building a virtual computer entirely within Python. I chose to embark on this task primarily as a means of teaching myself a bit more about how a computer does what it does. It was inpired by the excellent [YouTube series by Ben Eater](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU), and most of what I attempt is merely a replication of his work. I chose to attempt this in Python because I live in a cramped flat in London and can't really justify having a whole room (or even desk) dedicated to electronics. I also felt it would provide a usuful avenue for me to sharpen my Python skills. 

As this project advances I plan on fleshing out this introduction. Stay posted for more...
